Features not to be Tested,"### Features Not to Be Tested

#### Application: KeePass
#### Domain: Privacy & Security

In the development and quality assurance process of KeePass, certain features have been identified as candidates for exclusion from the current testing cycle. This determination is based on a thorough analysis of each feature's stability, relevance to the current project scope, and overall impact on the application's security and functionality. Below, we outline these features and provide a detailed rationale for their exclusion.

1. **Legacy Authentication Methods**
   - **Exclusion Rationale:** Legacy authentication methods such as basic username and password without multi-factor authentication have been superseded by more secure authentication mechanisms in KeePass. These methods are retained only for backward compatibility. Testing these could divert resources from more critical security features that need attention in the current release cycle.
   - **Justification:** These features are stable and have been unchanged for several release cycles. No new developments or changes have been made, making re-testing redundant.

2. **Static UI Elements**
   - **Exclusion Rationale:** Certain UI elements like static help text, logos, and user instruction panels do not interact with user data nor affect the application's core functionalities. As these elements are neither dynamic nor susceptible to changes in this release, they do not warrant re-testing.
   - **Justification:** Testing static UI elements can be considered low-impact concerning the overall application performance and security. Their functionality has been previously validated and remains unchanged.

3. **Export Function to Deprecated Formats**
   - **Exclusion Rationale:** KeePassâ€™s support for exporting data to certain older file formats (e.g., CSV files without encryption) is considered deprecated and is not encouraged for use. These features remain only for users who require legacy support and are not recommended for general use due to their lack of encryption.
   - **Justification:** Since these features are deprecated and do not align with the current security standards of KeePass, focusing testing efforts on them would not be a productive use of resources. The feature is stable and unchanged, and its use is discouraged.

4. **Drag-and-Drop Feature in Testing KeePass**
   - **Exclusion Rationale:** The drag-and-drop functionality for credentials within the KeePass interface is a user convenience feature and does not impact the core security or operational capabilities of the application. This feature has been extensively tested in prior releases and has shown no recent issues.
   - **Justification:** Given the stability and lack of recent changes to this functionality, re-testing it in the current cycle is unnecessary and would not be an efficient use of testing resources.

5. **Third-Party Plugin Interfaces**
   - **Exclusion Rationale:** While KeePass supports various third-party plugins, testing the compatibility and functionality of these plugins falls outside the scope of the core KeePass team. These are developed and maintained by external entities.
   - **Justification:** The responsibility for testing third-party plugins lies with their respective developers. KeePassâ€™s core testing will focus on the application's built-in features to ensure stability and security without extending to external add-ons.

By focusing testing efforts on areas that critically affect the performance, usability, and security of KeePass, we ensure the efficient allocation of resources and uphold the application's integrity.
