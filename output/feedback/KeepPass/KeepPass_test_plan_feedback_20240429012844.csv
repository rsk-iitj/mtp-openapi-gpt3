Glossary,"**KeePass**: A free, open-source password manager application that allows users to store multiple passwords in a single database, which is locked with one master key or a key file.

**Password Database**: A digital vault where user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, are stored securely. In KeePass, this database is encrypted and accessible only through a master password or key file.

**Master Password**: A primary password that grants access to the KeePass password database. It is the only password users need to memorize to unlock and access all other stored credentials.

**Composite Master Key**: A complex key used to unlock the KeePass database, which can be a combination of a master password and one or more key files.

**Key File**: A physical file used as a key to unlock the KeePass database. It serves as an additional security layer alongside or instead of the master password.

**Auto-Type**: A feature in KeePass that automatically fills in usernames and passwords in web forms or other applications based on the stored credentials.

**Portable KeePass**: A version of KeePass designed to run directly from a USB drive, allowing users to access their password database on multiple computers without needing to install the software on each device.

**Database Encryption**: The process of converting the KeePass database information into a secure format that cannot be easily interpreted without a key (master password or key file), ensuring the confidentiality of stored data.

**TAN (Transaction Authentication Number)**: A unique, one-time use password intended for a specific transaction or login session, enhancing security by preventing reuse.

**Open Source Software**: Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, or enhance. KeePass is an example of open source software, allowing users and developers to review its code for security and functionality.
